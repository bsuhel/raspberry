Raspberry school edition

Hello I am teacher, so that debian scholl edition on raspberry was developed for easy use on existing softvare and hardware school layout. I don't want GUI, extra mouse and keyboard. I want comunicate true RJ-45 and wifi accesspoint, ant use ssh, samba, apache and GPIO to comunicate with raspberry:)

And there is a lot of exercises:)
I just found that site, so give me a time to write something smart:)

For now there is my web site(In Slovene language, but you can just choose google translate) , with link to Live IP camera, Live raspberry where you can taste something, and google drive share directory with zip from that school distribution.
Port 22 is opened for SSH access, pls dond disturb enythink unles I must close something...:)

School distribution is tootaly opened with username pi (or in some case root) and password raspberry. That mean for every thing, SSID, WiFi Password, mysql , joomla, wordpress.....

I developed a lot project for industry, and I just took that distribution and closed it.
